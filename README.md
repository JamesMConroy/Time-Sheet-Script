I made this project to keep track of hours worked, and to learn some BASH Scripting.

The script takes a file name as an argument and inserts to the head of the file.
The data inserted is: whether you are clocking in or out, the date, and the local time.

	Ex: clock out Thur, Feb 5 - 5:15 PM

I use the script, by placing it in my path and aliasing job names to be the script + file.
